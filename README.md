# React Movie Search Engine

This is a minimalistic movie search engine built using React.js. The application allows users to search for movies by title and displays a list of matching results. Clicking on a movie displays additional information about it, such as the plot summary, release date, and rating.

The application uses the Movie DB API to retrieve movie data. It features a simple and clean UI design with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The code is organized using functional components and hooks, and it leverages the power of React to provide a fast and seamless user experience.
